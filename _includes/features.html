No need to back-haul tons of session data to a central database, keep that remote data where it makes sense - remote!</p>

All extracted sessions are 'cached' with accompanying incident logs centrally, just in case you need them later.</p>

Automatically parses event logs from common applications and security tools to pull out the session identifiers, uses those to pull the packet data you want to see.</p>
